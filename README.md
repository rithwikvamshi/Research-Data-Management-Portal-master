# Research-Data-Management-Portal
  This project is a platform for research data management. Here we provide a website to log the research and personal details of professors of a university. The complete project is made on the intention to make it available for the final year students and scholars of different departments. Students can view the research details of a particular faculty which helps them in choosing their project guide this also helps the students in finding the faculty according to their research interests.

  This website consists of two major portals, user portal and view portal. Through the user portal, the users(professors) are provided with personal accounts through which they can manage their data. Once the user is logged into their account, they are provided with the option of adding new research, update their present research details and to update their personal details. Through, view portal students, scholars are given the option of checking the work of any professor by searching with the help of name.
